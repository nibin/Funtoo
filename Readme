=======

This project uses cryptographic libraries from bouncycastle. By default, java restricts symmetric
encryption to key size of 32 bits. If support is required for more than 32 bits (upto 256 bits), then
two changes should be done.

 1. Add BCprovider "security.provider.9=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider" 
    in master providers properties file "/etc/java-6-sun/security/java.security"
 2. Copy the jce unrestricted cryptographic libraries(two jars) in 
 "/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/security"
